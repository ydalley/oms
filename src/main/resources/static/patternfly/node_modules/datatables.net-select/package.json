  "readme": "# Select for DataTables \n\nThis package contains distribution files for the [Select extension](https://datatables.net/extensions/select) for [DataTables](https://datatables.net/). Only the core software for this library is contained in this package - to be correctly styled, a styling package for Select must also be included. Styling options include DataTable's native styling, [Bootstrap](http://getboostrap.com) and [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/).\n\nSelect provides table item selection capabilities - rows, columns and cells can be selected individually or collectively. Complex selection operations such as operating system style selection (ctrl/cmd and shift click) for multiple rows can be enabled with a single option for a DataTable.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n### Browser\n\nFor inclusion of this library using a standard `<script>` tag, rather than using this package, it is recommended that you use the [DataTables download builder](//datatables.net/download) which can create CDN or locally hosted packages for you, will all dependencies satisfied.\n\n### npm\n\n```\nnpm install datatables.net-select\n```\n\n```\nvar $ = require( 'jquery' );\nrequire( 'datatables.net-select' )( window, $ );\n```\n\n### bower\n\n```\nbower install --save datatables.net-select\n```\n\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nFull documentation of the DataTables options, API and plug-in interface are available on the DOCS_LINK.
